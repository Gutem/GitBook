# The aim of this work

Just as in the Bitcoin ecosystem, in the beginning, there was quite a bit of knowledge fragmentatation - one blog post here, a forum post tutorial there, a misleading article there and so on. 

This guide tries to create an easy to access knowledge base that can help people from all around the world to start experimenting with blockchain technologies.

It is our belief that the crypto space has enough room for cooperation between many of the different blockchain projects. Hopefully through this work, we will get closer to a reality in which we all realize that as long as we experiment with blockchain related technologies, we enrich the decentralized ecosystem in our own unique ways - contributing to something bigger than any individual project or initiative.
