# Building on Ubuntu

**Note: cpp-ethereum is still under heavy development, Please file an [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues ) if you have problems with installing. For the time being most tests are done on the Ubuntu client, so this should be the most stable. The Windows client has had the least amount of tests.**
