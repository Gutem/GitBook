Into the ether
=======

As a crowd founding campaign, ethereum, represents a milestone from a number of angles:

* the biggest "one-time" crowdfunded project in the history of the Internet
* open source
* blockchain
* the most successful 42 days crowdfunding campaign. _Ever_


There are a number of developers and researchers who are either working for Ethereum or working on ideas as volunteers and happen to spend lots of time interacting with the Ethereum community, and this set of people has coalesced into a group dedicated to building out the vision set by Vitalik Buterin in the ethereum whitepaper. 

Thank you. 

This guide is for you.
