###Start with why

The _Internet_ is more than a company, organization or application. It offers a way for people to communicate, collaborate and trade resources and knowledge real-time at a planetary scale. In the past 20+ years the Internet has become indispensable and we rely heavily on it for many things - from talking to our loved ones to running world-wide economies. Considering how important the Internet is to us and humanity as a whole, it only make sense to have its foundations open, transparent and trustworthy. 

For the past few years centralized services such as Google and Facebook have steadily become **the internet** for many people. [The influence they have][1] on the choices and behavior of the totality of individual human beings translates to real power to influence the course of history and we should strive for a better solution that the ones available now, for this reason alone if nothing else. 

You might think we learned something the last 6000+ years of recorded history - or rather what's left of it. Numerous times we have seen burned books and libraries, attempts to edit the history of events for political or personal gain and the toxic nature of monopolies and centralization in general. Too much centralized power has never ended up well. 

Currently the Internet is written on water because it runs on top of data storage mediums designed to be edited and changed. It’s not the right technology for _everything_ and it introduces a number of wrong trust dimensions.  In some cases such  we **need** an immutable history. Things that are written, and just don’t change. 

Add on top of that the fact that your personal data (searches, posts, pictures, messages, etc) belong to **anyone but you** and you get a pretty grim picture of the digital reality we live in. Things have never been so centralized and at this scale in the history of our civilization. This is where we are now and things could certainly use some improvement. 

Ethereum is a 100% crowd founded, open source technology created out of necessity for a trustworthy foundation on which we can rebuild and heal the Internet. It is envisioned as a platform that enables people to easily build decentralized applications, **transparent and trustworthy by design**. From email services that **[don't read your emails][2]** to **unforgeable voting  systems**, an entire multi-verse of possibilities and applications is waiting to be explored by the brave and open-minded. 

Ethereum builders is a self organizing community that thrives on communication, mass collaboration and solution-oriented thinking. Use your creative freedom, **identify what inspires you, own it, and push it.** Take risks, learn from your mistakes, and most of all, have fun. You are not only welcome to experiment here but encouraged, so throw your craziest of ideas on the boards and have fun! 

From here on, together, we can do more :two_men_holding_hands:

If we can build a better system, then more than 2 billion people will have a way to regain control over their information, privacy and digital lives. This is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment. We deserve a neutral, open and trustworthy Internet with privacy as a standard, not a feature. Period. 

This is the dawn of the crypto renaissance :sunny:


#Our values

Our values converge in a culture that revolves around exploration, creativity, problem solving, and a willingness to push fast and iterate. We work hard as a team, have fun as a team, and we never take ourselves too seriously.

###1. Transparency
Transparency is the foundation for building trust in an open network. Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.

###2. Meritocracy
In a meritocracy, the best ideas win. Each person’s value comes from his or her individuality and uniqueness and the capacity to engage and interact with others to make the fruits of that uniqueness available. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather effort from the community. 

###3. Open Information
A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas. Spawned from this core idea, free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as an open and trustworthy public resource.

###4. Open collaboration
When we are free to collaborate we can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own and learn from each other in the process. 

###5. Rapid Prototyping
Learn by doing. Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, but that leads to better solutions found faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places. 

###6. Pluralism & Diversity
No one has done this before. This means that there is no "right" or "wrong" way of doing things and by definition it's a trial and error process. From each failed experiment we learn and improve for the next experiment. 

###7. Practical idealism
Technologies and solutions that can be generalized as _world positive_ are worthy to be pursued and explored. When others ask _why bother?_ we ask _why not?_
