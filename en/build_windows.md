# Installing cpp-ethereum on Windows

This will work on Windows 8.1. Other versions of Windows should work, but haven't been tested.

Get the [Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784). Download the 32 bit version (vcredist_x86.exe) even when you have a 64 bit Version of Windows.

Then, download the latest [stable](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20master%20branch/AlethZero-Win32-latest.7z) or [cutting edge](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20develop%20branch/AlethZero-Win32-latest.7z) binary version.
