# Serpent Tutorials


Let's write our first contract in serpent. Paste the following into a file called "mul2.se":

    def double(x):
         return(x * 2)

This contract is a simple two lines of code, and defines a function. Functions can be called either by transactions or by other contracts, and are the way that Serpent contracts provide an "interface" to other contracts and to transactions; for example, a contract defining a currency might have functions `send(to, value)` and `check_balance(address)`. 

Additionally, the Pyethereum testing environment that we will be using simply assumes that data input and output are in this format.

Now, let's try actually compiling the code. Type:

    > serpent compile mul2.se
    602380600b600039602e5660003560001a600014156022576020600160203760026020510260405260206040f25b5b6000f2

And there we go, that's the hexadecimal form of the code that you can put into transactions. Or, if you want to see opcodes:

    > serpent pretty_compile mul2.se
    [PUSH1, 35, DUP1, PUSH1, 11, PUSH1, 0, CODECOPY, PUSH1, 46, JUMP, PUSH1, 0, CALLDATALOAD, PUSH1, 0, BYTE, PUSH1, 0, EQ, ISZERO, PUSH1, 34, JUMPI, PUSH1, 32, PUSH1, 1, PUSH1, 32, CALLDATACOPY, PUSH1, 2, PUSH1, 32, MLOAD, MUL, PUSH1, 64, MSTORE, PUSH1, 32, PUSH1, 64, RETURN, JUMPDEST, JUMPDEST, PUSH1, 0, RETURN]

Alternatively, you can compile to LLL to get an intermediate representation:

    > serpent compile_to_lll mul2.se
    (seq 
      (return 0 
        (lll 
          (seq 
            (def ('double 'x) 
              (seq 
                (set '_temp7_1 (mul (get 'x) 2))
                (return (ref '_temp7_1) 32)
              )
            )
          )
          0
        )
      )
    )

This shows you the machinery that is going on inside. As with most contracts, the outermost layer of code exists only to copy the data of the inner code during initialization and return it, since the code returned during initialization is the code that will be executed every time the contract is called; in the EVM you can see this with the `CODECOPY` opcode, and in LLL this corresponds to the `lll` meta-operation. In the innermost layer, we set a variable `'_temp7_1` to equal twice the input, and then supply the memory address of that variable, and the length 32, to the `RETURN` opcode. The `def` mechanism itself is later translated into opcodes that actually unpack the bytes of the transaction data into the variables seen in the LLL.

Now, what if you want to actually run the contract? That is where [pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum) comes in. Open up a Python console in the same directory, and run:

    > from pyethereum import tester as t
    > s = t.state()
    > c = s.contract('mul2.se')
    > s.send(t.k0, c, 0, funid=0, abi=[42])
    [84]
    > s.send(t.k0, c, 0, funid=0, abi=[303030])
    [606060]

The second line initializes a new state (ie. a genesis block). The third line creates a new contract, and sets `c` to its address. The fourth line sends a transaction from private key zero (the `tester` submodule includes ten pre-made key/address pairs at `k0`, `a0`, `k1`, `a1`, etc) to the address of the contract with 0 wei, calling function 0 (ie. the first function in the contract) with data 42, and we see 84 predictably come out.

Note that if you want to send a transaction to such a contract in the testnet or livenet, you will need to package up the transaction data for "call function 0 with data 42". The command line instruction for this is:

    > serpent encode_abi 0 42
    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a

The first byte (ie. two hex characters) always represents the function ID; for example, if we were calling the function with ID 9 in some contract instead, we would do:

    > serpent encode_abi 9 42
    09000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a

Then, after that, each argument is packed into 32 bytes. So if we wanted to encode two variables we would do:  

    > serpent encode_abi 9 42 20125
    09000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e9d

Note that there are advanced features in Serpent for making each argument take up less than 32 bytes, but we will ignore these for now.

### Example: Name Registry

Having a multiply-by-two function on the blockchain is kind of boring. So let's do something marginally more interesting: a name registry. The main function will be a `register(key, value)` operation which checks if a given key was already taken, and if is unoccupied then register it with the desired value and return 1; if the key is already occupied return 0. We will also add a second function to check the value associated with a particular key. Let's try it out:

    def register(key, value):
        # Key not yet claimed
        if not self.storage[key]:
            self.storage[key] = value
            return(1)
        else:
            return(0)  # Key already claimed

    def ask(key):
        return(self.storage[key])

Here, we see a few parts in action. First, we have the `key` and `value` variables that the function takes as arguments. The third line is a comment; it does not get compiled and only serves to remind you what the code does. Then, we have a standard if/else clause, which checks if `self.storage[key]` is zero (ie. unclaimed), and if it is then it sets `self.storage[key] = value` and returns 1. Otherwise, it returns zero (which we expressed as a literal array just to exhibit this other style of returning; it's more cumbersome but lets you do return multiple values). `self.storage` is also a pseudo-array, acting like an array but without any particular memory location.

Now, paste the code into "namecoin.se", if you wish try compiling it to LLL, opcodes or EVM, and let's try it out in the pyethereum tester environment:

    > from pyethereum import tester as t
    > s = t.state()
    > c = s.contract('namecoin.se')
    > s.send(t.k0, c, 0, funid=0, abi=[0x67656f726765, 45])
    [1]
    > s.send(t.k1, c, 0, funid=0, abi=[0x67656f726765, 20])
    [0]
    > s.send(t.k2, c, 0, funid=0, abi=[0x6861727279, 65])
    [1]
    > s.send(t.k3, c, 0, funid=1, abi=[0x6861727279])
    [65]

`funid` is the index of the function, in the order in which it appears in the contract; here, 0 is for `register` and 1 is for `ask`. If we wanted to encode the transaction data for that first call, we would do: 

    > serpent encode_abi 0 0x67656f726765 45
    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000067656f726765000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002d

### Including files, and calling other contracts

Once your projects become larger, you will not want to put everything into the same file; things become particularly inconvenient when one piece of code needs to create a contract. Fortunately, the process for splitting code into multiple files is quite simple. Make the following two files:

mul2.se:

    def double(x):
        return(x * 2)

returnten.se:

    extern mul2: [double]
    
    MUL2 = create('mul2.se')
    return(MUL2.double(5, as=mul2))

And open Python:

    > from pyethereum import tester as t
    > s = t.state()
    > c = s.contract('returnten.se')
    > s.send(t.k0, c, 0, [])
    [10]

Note that here we introduced several new features. Particularly:

* The `create` command to create a contract using code from another file
* The `extern` keyword to declare a class of contract for which we know the names of the functions
* The interface for calling other contracts

`create` is self-explanatory; it creates a contract and returns the address to the contract. The way `extern` works is that you declare a class of contract, in this case `mul2`, and then list in an array the names of the functions, in this case just `double`. From there, given any variable containing an address, you can do `x.double(arg1, as=mul2)` to call the address stored by that variable. The `as` keyword provides the class that we're using (to determine which function ID `double` corresponds to; there may be another class where `double` corresponds to 7). You do have the option of omitting the `as` keyword, but this comes at the peril of ambiguity if you are using two classes that have the same function name. The arguments are the values provided to the function. If you provide too few arguments, the rest are filled to zero, and if you provide too many the extra ones are ignored. Function calling also has some other optional arguments:

* `gas=12414` - call the function with 12414 gas instead of the default (all gas)
* `value=10^19` - send 10^19 wei (10 ether) along with the message
* `data=x`, `datasz=5` - call the function with 5 values from the array `x`; note that this replaces other function arguments. `data` without `datasz` is illegal
* `outsz=7` - by default, Serpent processes the output of a function by taking the first 32 bytes and returning it as a value. However, if `outsz` is used as here, the function will instead return an array containing 7 values; if you type `y = x.fun(arg1, outsz=7)` then you will be able to access the output via `y[0]`, `y[1]`, etc.

Another, similar, operation to `create` is `(inset 'filename')`, which simply puts code into a particular place without adding a separate contract.

### Storage data structures

In more complicated contracts, you will often want to store data structures in storage to represent certain objects. For example, you might have a decentralized exchange contract that stores the balances of users in multiple currencies, as well as open bid and ask orders where each order has a price and a quantity. For this, Serpent has a built-in mechanism for defining your own structures. For example, in such a decentralized exchange contract you might see:

    data user_balances[][]
    data orders[](buys[](user, price, quantity), sells[](user, price, quantity))

Then, you might do something like:

    def fill_buy_order(currency, order_id):
        # Available amount buyer is willing to buy
        q = self.orders[currency].buys[order_id].quantity
        # My balance in the currency
        bal = self.user_balances[msg.sender][currency]
        # The buyer
        buyer = self.orders[currency].buys[order_id].user
        if q > 0:
            # The amount we can actually trade
            amount = min(q, bal)
            # Trade the currency against the base currency
            self.user_balances[msg.sender][currency] -= amount
            self.user_balances[buyer][currency] += amount
            self.user_balances[msg.sender][0] += amount * self.orders[currency].buys[order_id].price
            self.user_balances[buyer][0] -= amount * self.orders[currency].buys[order_id].price
            # Reduce the remaining quantity on the order
            self.orders[currency].buys[order_id].quantity -= amount

Notice how we define the data structures at the top, and then use them throughout the contract. These data structure gets and sets are converted into storage accesses in the background, so the data structures are persistent. 

The language for doing data structures is simple. First, we can do simple variables:

    data blah

    x = self.blah
    self.blah = x + 1

Then, we can do arrays, both finite and infinite:

    data blah[1243]
    data blaz[]

    x = self.blah[505]
    y = self.blaz[3**160]
    self.blah[125] = x + y

Note that finite arrays are always preferred, because it will cost less gas to calculate the storage index associated with a finite array index lookup. And we can do tuples, where each element of the tuple is itself a valid data structure:

    data body(head(eyes[2], nose, mouth), arms[2], legs[2])

    x = self.body.head.nose
    y = self.body.arms[1]

And we can do arrays of tuples:

    data bodies[100](head(eyes[2], nose, mouth), arms[2](fingers[5], elbow), legs[2])

    x = self.bodies[45].head.eyes[1]
    y = self.bodies[x].arms[1].fingers[3]

Note that the following is unfortunately not legal:

    data body(head(eyes[2], nose, mouth), arms[2], legs[2])

    x = self.body.head
    y = x.eyes[0]

Accesses have to descend fully in a single statement. To see how this could be used in a simpler example, let's go back to our name registry, and upgrade it so that when a user registers a key they become the owner of that key, and the owner of a key has the ability to (1) transfer ownership, and (2) change the value. We'll remove the return values here for simplicity.

    data registry[](owner, value)

    def register(key):
        # Key not yet claimed
        if not self.registry[key].owner:
            self.registry[key].owner = msg.sender

    def transfer_ownership(key, new_owner):
        if self.registry[key].owner == msg.sender:
            self.registry[key].owner = new_owner

    def set_value(key, new_value):
        if self.registry[key].owner == msg.sender:
            self.registry[key].value = new_value

    def ask(key):
        return([self.registry[key].owner, self.registry[key].value], 2)

Note that in the last ask command, the function returns an array of 2 values. If you wanted to call the registry, you would have needed to do something like `o = registry.ask(key, outsz=2)` and you could have then used `o[0]` and `o[1]` to recover the owner and value. 

### Simple arrays in memory

The syntax for arrays in memory are different: they can only be finite and cannot have tuples or more complicated structures.

Example:

    def bitwise_or(x, y):
        blah = array(1243)
        blah[567] = x
        blah[568] = y
        blah[569] = blah[567] | blah[568]
        return(blah[569])

There are also two functions for dealing with arrays:

    len(x)

Returns the length of array x.

    shrink_array(x, s)

Shrink the length of array x to size s (useful just before passing the array as an argument to a function).

### Arrays and Functions

Functions can also take arrays as arguments, and return arrays.

    def compose(inputs:a):
        return(inputs[0] + inputs[1] * 10 + inputs[2] * 100)

    def decompose(x):
        return([x % 10, (x % 100) / 10, x / 100]:a)

Putting the `:a` after a function argument means it is an array, and putting it inside a return statement returns the value as an array (just doing `return([x,y,z])` would return the integer which is the memory location of the array).

If a contract calls itself, then it will autodetect which arguments should be arrays and parse them accordingly, so this works fine:

    def compose(inputs:a, radix):
        return(inputs[0] + inputs[1] * radix + inputs[1] * radix ** 2)

    def main():
        return self.compose([1,2,3,4,5], 100)

However, if you want to call another contract that takes arrays as arguments, then you will need to put a "signature" into the extern declaration:

    extern composer: [compose:ai, main]

Here, `ai` means "an array followed by an integer".

### Strings

There are two types of strings in Serpent: short strings, eg. `"george"`, and long strings, eg. `text("afjqwhruqwhurhqkwrhguqwhrkuqwrkqwhwhrugquwrguwegtwetwet")`. Short strings, given simply in quotes as above, are treated as numbers; long strings, surrounded by the `text` keyword as above, are treated as array-like objects; you can do `getch(str, index)` and `setch(str, index)` to manipulate characters in strings (doing `str[0]` will treat the string as an array and try to fetch the first 32 characters as a number).

To use strings as function arguments or outputs, use the `s` tag, much like you would use `a` for arrays. `len(s)` gives you the length of a string, and `shrink` works for strings the same way as for arrays too.

### Macros

**WARNING: Relatively new/untested feature, here be ~~dragons~~ serpents**

Macros allow you to create rewrite rules which provide additional expressivity to the language. For example, suppose that you wanted to create a command that would compute the median of three values. You could simply do:

    macro median($a, $b, $c):
        min(min(smax($a, $b), max($a, $c)), max($b, $c))

Then, if you wanted to use it somewhere in your code, you just do:

    x = median(5, 9, 7)

Or to take the max of an array:

    macro maxarray($a:$asz):
        $m = 0
        $i = 0
        while i < $asz:
            $m = max($m, $a[i])
            $i += 1
        $m

    x = maxarray([1, 9, 5, 6, 2, 4]:6)

For a highly contrived example of just how powerful macros can be, see https://github.com/ethereum/serpent/blob/poc7/examples/peano.se

Note that macros are not functions; they are copied into code every time they are used. Hence, if you have a long macro, you may instead with to make the macro call an actual function. Additionally, note that the dollar signs on variables are important; if you omit a dollar sign in the pattern $a then the macro will only match a variable actually called a. You can also create dollar sign variables that are in the substitution pattern, but not the search pattern; this will generate a variable with a random prefix each instance of the macro. You can also create new variables without a dollar sign inside a substitution pattern, but then the same variable will be shared across all instances of the pattern and with uses of that variable outside the pattern.

### Types

**WARNING: Relatively new/untested feature, here be ~~dragons~~ serpents**

An excellent compliment to macros is Serpent's ghetto type system, which can be combined with macros to produce quite interesting results. Let us simply show this with an example:

    type float: [a, b, c]

    macro float($x) + float($y):
        float($x + $y)

    macro float($x) - float($y):
        float($x - $y)

    macro float($x) * float($y):
        float($x * $y / 2^32)

    macro float($x) / float($y):
        float($x * 2^32 / $y)

    macro unfloat($x):
        $x / 2^32

    macro floatfy($x):
        float($x * 2^32)

    macro float($x) = float($y):
        $x = $y

    macro with(float($x), float($y), $z):
        with($x, $y, $z)

    a = floatfy(25)
    b = a / floatfy(2)
    c = b * b
    return(unfloat(c))

This returns 156, the integer portion of 12.5^2. A purely integer-based version of this code would have simply returned 144. An interesting use case would be rewriting the [elliptic curve signature pubkey recovery code](https://github.com/ethereum/serpent/blob/df0aa0e1285d7667d4a0cc81b1e11e0abb31fff3/examples/ecc/jacobian_add.se) using types in order to make the code neater by making all additions and multiplications implicitly modulo P, or using [long integer types](https://github.com/ethereum/serpent/blob/poc7/examples/long_integer_macros.se) to do RSA and other large-value-based cryptography in EVM code.

### Miscellaneous

Additional Serpent coding examples can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/serpent/tree/master/examples

The three other useful features in the tester environment are:

* Block access - you can dig around `s.block` to see block data (eg. `s.block.number`, `s.block.get_balance(addr)`, `s.block.get_storage_data(addr, index)`)
* Snapshots - you can do `x = s.snapshot()` and `s.revert(x)`
* Advancing blocks - you can do `s.mine(100)` and 100 blocks magically pass by with a 60-second interval between blocks. `s.mine(100, addr)` mines into a particular address.
* Full block data dump - type `s.block.to_dict()`

Serpent also gives you access to many "special variables"; the full list is:

* `tx.origin` - the sender of the transaction
* `tx.gas` - gas remaining
* `tx.gasprice` - gas price of the transaction
* `msg.sender` - the sender of the message
* `msg.value` - the number of wei (smallest units of ether) sent with the message
* `self` - the contract's own address
* `self.balance` - the contract's balance
* `x.balance` (for any x) - that account's balance
* `block.coinbase` - current block miner's address
* `block.timestamp` - current block timestamp
* `block.prevhash` - previous block hash
* `block.difficulty` - current block difficulty
* `block.number` - current block number
* `block.gaslimit` - current block gaslimit

Serpent recognises the following "special functions":

* `init` - executed upon contract creation
* `shared` - executed before running `init` and user functions
* `any` - executed before any user functions

There are also special commands for a few crypto operations; particularly:

* `addr = ecrecover(h, v, r, s)` - determines the address that produced the elliptic curve signature `v, r, s` of the hash `h`
* `x = sha256(a, 4)` - returns the sha256 hash of the 128 bytes consisting of the 4-item array starting from `a`
* `x = ripemd160(a, 4)` - same as above but for ripemd160
* To hash an arbitrary number of bytes, use chars syntax.  Example: `x = sha256([0xf1fc122bc7f5d74df2b9441a42a1469500000000000000000000000000000000], chars=16)` - returns the sha256 of the first 16 bytes.  Note: padding with trailing zeroes, otherwise the first 16 bytes will be zeroes, and the sha256 of it will be computed instead of the desired.

### Tips

* If a function is not returning the result you expect, double-check that all variables are correct: there is no error/warning when using an undeclared variable.

* `Invalid argument count or LLL function` usually means you just called foo() instead of `self.foo()`.

* Sometimes you may be intending to use unsigned operators. eg div() and lt() instead of '/' and '<'.
