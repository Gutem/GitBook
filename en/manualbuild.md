# Manual Build

Ethereum has binaries for common platforms:
* **[Mac OS X, stable](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/OSX%20C%2B%2B%20master%20branch/AlethZero-OSX-latest.tar.bz2)** and **[Mac OS X, cutting-edge](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/OSX%20C%2B%2B%20develop%20branch/AlethZero-OSX-latest.tar.bz2)**. You may also choose to [use Homebrew](Installing Clients#installing-cpp-ethereum-on-os-x) (a longer process but you can edit the source code).
* **[Windows 32-bit, stable](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20master%20branch/AlethZero-Win32-latest.7z)** and **[Windows 32-bit, cutting-edge](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20develop%20branch/AlethZero-Win32-latest.7z)**; you'll also need to install the [MSVC Redistributable](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784) prior. *TODO: Bundle this or static link*
*  **Ubuntu**



If you like the idea of developing on Ethereum, the best development platform currently is Ubuntu 14.04 with the QtCreator IDE. If you would like to know more about building Ethereum for your platform you'll want to inspect:
